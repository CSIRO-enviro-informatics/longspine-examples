# LongSpine Examples
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) data and [SPARQL(https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)] query examples for use with the [Longitudinal Spine of Government Functions demonstrator](https://longspine.cat).

These are examples that can be used to test the capabilities of the LongSpine demonstrator. All of the examples are, if RDF, uploaded into the demonstrator cache or, if  SPARQL, listed on the [Examples Page](https://longspine.cat/examples). Where data is loaded, the Named Graph URI <http://example.org/example/{EXAMPLE_ID}> is used where `{EXAMPLE_ID}` is `VL1` etc from the list below.

Each example has notes on their parts and how to use them in README files within their folders.


## Examples
1. **VL1** - a Government Structural Unit classified with two functions from [AGIFT](http://data.naa.gov.au/def/agift)
1. **VL2** - queries showing how to get the functions from one vocab that it is not directly linked to with Linksets
1. **D1** - query to get all of the Government Structural Units from a dataset for a named time period
1. **D2** - query to get all of the Government Structural Units responsible for a particular function from all datasets for a named time period
1. **D3** - query to find the Portfolios for a Matter over time
